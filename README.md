# Statistical Applications & Analysis

This repository is a curated collection of **statistical projects** that demonstrate how theoretical concepts in **statistics and data science** can be applied to real-world datasets for meaningful insights.

The focus is on **statistical thinking** and **analytical methods** rather than on any single programming language. Projects may be implemented in **R, Python, or other tools** as the collection grows.

## Projects

### 1. Sales Data Analysis

- Cleaned and transformed e-commerce sales data.
- Conducted **descriptive statistics** and correlation studies (Pearson, Spearman).
- Analyzed the effect of **discount strategies** on **customer ratings**.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews

- Preprocessed and tokenized product reviews.
- Applied **lexicon-based sentiment scoring** (AFINN).
- Classified reviews as **Positive, Negative, or Neutral**.
- Extracted insights on **customer satisfaction and opinion trends**.

### 3. Retail Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

- Modeled weekly product demand using **time series forecasting** (ARIMA).
- Calculated **optimal reorder quantities** to balance stockouts and overstocking.
- Dataset: ~49,000 simulated e-commerce transactions.
- Applications: inventory planning, purchasing decisions, warehouse optimization.

## Statistical Concepts Applied

- **Descriptive statistics** (summary measures, distributions)
- **Correlation analysis** (Pearson, Spearman)
- **Text mining & sentiment analysis**
- **Time series analysis** (ARIMA forecasting)
- **Optimization in inventory control**

## Technologies Used

- **R / Python** (depending on project folder)
- **tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2, tidyr)** for data wrangling & visualization
- **tidytext** for text mining
- **forecast** for time series modeling
- Standard Python libraries will be added in future projects (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.)

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rithesh077/statistics_projects
   cd statistics_projects
   ```
2. Naviagate to the desired Folder directory.
3. Open the R or Python Script.
4. Run the code to produce the desired results.
5. Outputs are saved in output/figures or output/tables directories.

## Future Enhancements

## Future Enhancements

- **Add Python Based Projects**: Extend repository with statistical applications implemented in Python for broader coverage.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Incorporate predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to complement classical statistical analysis.
- **Advanced Forecasting**: Apply multivariate time-series approaches (VAR, Prophet) to capture seasonality and external regressors.
- **Enhanced Text Analytics**: Support multiple sentiment lexicons (AFINN, NRC, Bing) for richer sentiment classification.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Build Shiny apps or Plotly dashboards for dynamic data visualization and exploration.
- **Automated Data Pipelines**: Implement ETL workflows to integrate real-world streaming data from APIs or databases.
- **Reusable Templates**: Create modular project templates so this repo can serve as a public learning framework for applied statistics.
